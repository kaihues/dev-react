Kai in the sky!! Rainbow has always been my <i>favorite<i> color, 
  but tbh, 
  it changes. 
Yesterday i’m feeling red, ready to record, ready to reflect, 
<i>Today<i>, 
  I wore maroon. 
  Or maybe magenta. 
  Whatever…

i really valued Kai’s Hues in this project, 
  but i felt really nervous that he didn’t really enjoy my company. 

I also, ya know, need my space. 

I struggle with communication, 
  so I’m not sure if we’re cool, 
  but I guess it’s all good. 
I wonder if I was waiting for an invitation? 
  Then again, I wonder if Kai was, also?

As far as the API goes, 
  I’ve decided I’m done thinking about. 
  Ok, maybe I’m not. 

I’m still thinking about it, 
  but I’m not stressing it. 
  I can’t control everything, 
no matter how hard I try. 
  And damn, I do be tryin. 

Some people are cat people, 
some people are dog people, 
some people like horses…

Anyways, I’m sorry for being an apple… 

I still think <i>apples<i> are <i>awesome<i>. 

But shoutout to all the pear. 
Beautiful, beautiful pear.

Sincerely,
Riley Meere























There’s another poem on the following line, but don’t read it if you’ve already been down that rabbit hole…
Hey, it happened to you, too? 
It sounds like a song I’ve heard before. 
People are going to think I’m crazy. 
“Don’t talk about fight club” , 
“everyone talks about Fight Club.” 
Good grief, 
I hate him. 
Just saying… Just kidding… Just wondering… Just wait… 
Love thy neighbor. Mama’s too proud. Oh, quiet!!!!! Purple people! NOW! let’s be LOUD. 

Oh, crap.

I totally forgot.
